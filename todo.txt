Hybrid Speedups
Hybrid heuristics
Hybrid convergence.  

TWO approaches to hybrid; LP splitting, vs. MIP.

Heuristic for hybrid blocks
 - Allow absolute value in cost expressions. ?  Can minimize absolute
 values, can't maximize them.  

; Combine LPs, 

; Batch changes to LPs, so we don't do lots of unnecessary solves. 


;; Allow for exact descriptions
;; Upper bounds rather than solving LPs? 
;; ...?

;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;; General TODO

think about implicit pruning (i.e., decomposition, etc.)

Subgoal caching / plan tying (i.e., cost for X at least cost for Y -
distance to Y from X).   

Warehouse hierarchy doesn't allow move(b,c,c), which could be needed to get
through tall stack.  

Think about connection between hierarchical methods and first-order
theorem proving.  Pessimistic descriptions are not pure logical
statements ! 
 
Later

Handle duplicate plans properly in full graph.

Fix regression for simple valuations ?

Add NCStrips tests.

Fancier PDF display ?

Ideas on probabilistic descriptions, synthesis, starting with flat
hierarchy, learning descriptions, macros, hierarchies bottom up.
Useful HLAs are ones with high success probability, low computational
complexity.   All of these things are context-sensitive, can be
imprecise, except for solid opt/pess descriptions.  

Check up on forall conditions in NCSTRIPS.
