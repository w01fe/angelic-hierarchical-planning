Think hard about what makes a "useful" action.  

Look at alternations of moving a and B, or just look at the 30 LPs for
the 3-move plan.

  LPs multiply exponentially with number of times something put on
  single surface (e.g., table?)

- Further investigate proliferation
- Implement subsumption for CLP states, for debugging if nothing
- else. 
- Look at using MIPs
  
Heuristic for simple-road-trip?


Make sure we're not assuming valuations are non-empty somewhere? 

Note: with lazy turned on, we're not beign pessimisticly correct (??)
Yes we are.  

How can we properly use pessimistic descriptions? 

; consider changing carry cost to block weight

; state abstraction hierarchy for suboptimal search (find feasible
; solution, then look at numbers) ...



; Look at existing PDDL domains

; Look at refinement ordering -- should really refine move-blocks
  first. ?

 
 
  consider allowing descriptions to introduce numeric variables? 

  
Optimize
More domains? 
 - Assembly
 - .....

Look into clojureatica/incanter (?)


;; Soon

Have another stab looking at Biundo work.

Strict inequalities on move actions with current hierarchy may prevent
picking up / dropping blocks already flush with top; moreover, with
nonzero switching cost, current hierarchy is suboptimal.

TODO: don't add vars to LP if consted, at least. (also in fixed-lp-vals)
  
Remove redundancies in solution extraction (currently 20% of time)

;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;; Implement

Hybrid Speedups
Hybrid heuristics
Hybrid convergence.  

TWO approaches to hybrid; LP splitting, vs. MIP.

Heuristic for hybrid blocks
 - Allow absolute value in cost expressions. ?  Can minimize absolute
 values, can't maximize them.  

;; Look at incanter/ clojueratica
;; Consider MIPS as representation for valuations.

; Combine LPs, 

; Batch changes to LPs, so we don't do lots of unnecessary solves. 

;; TODO: heuristics

;; TODO: when we commit to a provably optimal high-level plan, 
we should also commit to these state variable values...

;; Allow for exact descriptions
;; Upper bounds rather than solving LPs? 


;; Domains
trading game (cities, items, capacities)
parking

;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;; General TODO

think about implicit pruning (i.e., decomposition, etc.)

Subgoal caching / plan tying (i.e., cost for X at least cost for Y -
distance to Y from X).   

Warehouse hierarchy doesn't allow move(b,c,c), which could be needed to get
through tall stack.  

Think about connection between hierarchical methods and first-order
theorem proving.  Pessimistic descriptions are not pure logical
statements ! 
 
Later

Handle duplicate plans properly in full graph.

Fix regression for simple valuations ?

Add NCStrips tests.

Fancier PDF display ?

Ideas on probabilistic descriptions, synthesis, starting with flat
hierarchy, learning descriptions, macros, hierarchies bottom up.
Useful HLAs are ones with high success probability, low computational
complexity.   All of these things are context-sensitive, can be
imprecise, except for solid opt/pess descriptions.  

Check up on forall conditions in NCSTRIPS.

Add handling of guaranteed objects to smart-csps, so we can use
foralls in preconditions.



TODO: start using journler to record activities and REPL commands.
