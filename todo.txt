Note about consistency with AHLRTA* -- have a flag on descriptions for
consistent?, raise extra errors when true ?


TODO: enforce consistency in AHLRTA*

TODO: weighted A*, optimistic A* need not reopen states to preserve
suboptimality bound ? (see ARA* paper)

TODO: ARA*

Add tests for decomposed, weighted, optimistic offline algs.

Add NCStrips tests.

Fancier PDF display ?

Ideas on probabilistic descriptions, synthesis, starting with flat
hierarchy, learning descriptions, macros, hierarchies bottom up.
Useful HLAs are ones with high success probability, low computational
complexity.   All of these things are context-sensitive, can be
imprecise, except for solid opt/pess descriptions.  

Check up on forall conditions in NCSTRIPS.
