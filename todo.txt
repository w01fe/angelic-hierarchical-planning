Figure out if was-tight? is correct condition, get rid of it?
Seems correct (implies complex condition)?

Change ALT to option-sets/maps ?

Improve efficiency of graph check, by at least changing to mutable DSs.

Add tests for decomposed, weighted, optimistic offline algs. 


;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;; General TODO

 
Later


Add NCStrips tests.

Fancier PDF display ?

Ideas on probabilistic descriptions, synthesis, starting with flat
hierarchy, learning descriptions, macros, hierarchies bottom up.
Useful HLAs are ones with high success probability, low computational
complexity.   All of these things are context-sensitive, can be
imprecise, except for solid opt/pess descriptions.  

Check up on forall conditions in NCSTRIPS.
