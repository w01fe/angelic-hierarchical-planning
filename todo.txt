; TODO TODO: :full graph is incorrect; we either need to turn off
  duplicate plan elimination, or somehow merge ancestor sets. 

;; TODO: turn off caching when doing the full graph thing?  Or keep
   track of "parent" pointers on a per-plan x node, not per-ALT-node basis


; TODO: check for pruning on expansion, not storage -- otherwise, can
  end up with no pruning at all (?) (two equivalent plans, each has
  cost go up by 1 each time we refine)?  Possible, but unlikely.  

;; TODO: put back finish!  Otherwise, with multiple goal states we may
   do n times worse where n is # of goal states.

; Ideally, pruning condition should reduce to A* graph given
  consistency, flat strips hierarchy.
; Suppose we assume consistency.

; Inconsistency of, e.g., WW heuristic can be a real problem.


; Prefix check (????) 


; Add consistency enforcement to ALT, or graph search is incorrect. ?

; Fix ALT in case of overlapping plans. (check up on this also.)

; Remove hack to ALT to show prettier graphs.


; Check on A*-graph/sloppy ALT discrepancies. (tiebreak upper-reward-bound?)

Clause-based subsumption for ALTs. (will help with WW navigation ?)s


;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;; General TODO


Later


Add NCStrips tests.

Fancier PDF display ?

Ideas on probabilistic descriptions, synthesis, starting with flat
hierarchy, learning descriptions, macros, hierarchies bottom up.
Useful HLAs are ones with high success probability, low computational
complexity.   All of these things are context-sensitive, can be
imprecise, except for solid opt/pess descriptions.  

TODO: figure out what to do with forall conditions in NCSTRIPS.
