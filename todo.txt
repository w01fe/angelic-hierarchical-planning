TODO: add tests!!!

; Idea : JIT grounder for hlas?! 
 
; TODO: too many instantiations?!
     ; Allow vars in NCSTRIPS (reduce #), and/or 
     ; improve JIT ref-generator (forget about grounding)
     ;  - (compile expressions, using constants?)
  ; !!! IF REFS don't depend on it, shouldn't be a var.
        or something.

randomize refinement ordering ??

longer term 
 - planning graph (+ relaxed)

 - warehouse world
  - forall in ncstrips precondition
 
 - quantified effects, etc.  

 - variables in ncstrips, effects and costs

 - add propositional-domain, propositional-instance interfaces?


; Observation - constant simplifier doesn't help too much when
 you have ref generator

; Idea : JIT grounder for hlas?! 


; Idea: angelic iwthout sets of states, just state abstraction?!
