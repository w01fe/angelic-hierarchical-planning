Relationship between (strict) A* graph pruning
(eliminating duplicate nodes) and what we get with ALTs and AHA*.

Now, its fine to eliminate duplicate plans (no more ancestors).?  

Understanding decomposed planning.


Ideas on probabilistic descriptions, synthesis, starting with flat
hierarchy, learning descriptions, macros, hierarchies bottom up.
Useful HLAs are ones with high success probability, low computational
complexity.   All of these things are context-sensitive, can be
imprecise, except for solid opt/pess descriptions.  



TODO: figure out what to do with forall conditions in NCSTRIPS.
