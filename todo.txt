Look at HLA order! 

PUT BACK pruning in construct-immediate-refinement!

beware of real-valued costs + pruning. 

Kernel-map type version of graph planning.

Subgoal caching / plan tying (i.e., cost for X at least cost for Y -
distance to Y from X).   

Hierarchy doesn't allow move(b,c,c), which could be needed to get
through tall stack.  

Tiebreaking in AHA* (depht-first) can make huge difference ...
  Investigate difference compared to experiments just run.  (AGAIN,
  had bug)
 - Should also add this to tree/graph (flat) A* search ?!
  ( does not seem to really matter ...)
  - 

TODO: weighted A*, optimistic A* need not reopen states to preserve
suboptimality bound ? (see ARA* paper)

TODO: ARA*

Add tests for decomposed, weighted, optimistic offline algs. 

put back was-tight?  (removed for easy description in paper.)

think about implicit pruning (i.e., decomposition, etc.)

;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;; General TODO

Think about connection between hierarchical methods and first-order
theorem proving.  Pessimistic descriptions are not pure logical
statements ! 
 
Later

Fix regression for simple valuations ?

Add NCStrips tests.

Fancier PDF display ?

Ideas on probabilistic descriptions, synthesis, starting with flat
hierarchy, learning descriptions, macros, hierarchies bottom up.
Useful HLAs are ones with high success probability, low computational
complexity.   All of these things are context-sensitive, can be
imprecise, except for solid opt/pess descriptions.  

Check up on forall conditions in NCSTRIPS.
